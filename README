This project involves development of a FAT32 filesystem for small microcontrollers.
This will be originally developed for the MDK OS to read FAT32 filesytem.

Development of this project will be done outside of any tree and debugging will be
done using the standard libraries. To integrate this project into an existing 
microcontroller project appropriate changes has to be done for the microcontroller/microprocessor
environment.



Understanding of the FAT Filesystem.
===================================
MBR: Master boot record.
The Master boot record is 512 bytes. The master boot record ends with the 
signature 0x55 0xAA.
The 64 bytes behind the signature contains the start of the partition table
entry. There are 4 partition table entries each of 16 bytes.

The following diagram explains this:

Master Boot Record:
     ___________________

	|P1_______|_________|
	|P2_______|_________|
	|P3_______|_________|
	|P4		  |0x55 0xAA|
	---------------------

P1,P2,P3 and P4 contains the partition table of 16 bytes each.

Observations with the partition scheme
--------------------------------------

I am seeing multiple boot signature 0x55 0xAA (at least 3) with the 
MBR partition data entry being empty. How should I be checking the 
partition info?
