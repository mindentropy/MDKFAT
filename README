This project involves development of a FAT32 filesystem for small microcontrollers.
This will be originally developed for the MDK OS to read FAT32 filesytem.

Development of this project will be done outside of any tree and debugging will be
done using the standard libraries. To integrate this project into an existing 
microcontroller project appropriate changes has to be done for the microcontroller/microprocessor
environment.
